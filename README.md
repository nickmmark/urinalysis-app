Prototype app to interpret urinalysis dipstick 

# background
I conceived of using a mobile phone to interpret urinalysis dipsticks while doing an away rotation in Ghana during medical school. It occured to me that there is significant inter-observer variability in performing and interpreting urinalysis dipstick results, which greatly limits the utility of the test. Using a smartphone camera to interpret the strip could standardize interpretation (improving accuracy) and provide a mechanism for documenting the observed results. Although resources are limited, smartphones equipped with cameras and urinalysis dipsticks are widely available even in low and middle income countries.
